<h1 align="center">Card Builder Game</h1> 

## Intro
Hey, my name is **Nick**, i'm a beginner Front-end Dev and  this is my first "big" project. 
I was inspired by ["Slay the spire"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) game and try to build the same mini game-project on JS.
Thank you and enjoy.

## Description

The main goal is defeat your opponent by playing cards which can do damage, defend you and some of them 
have additional effects.

The game starts with a choice, each player chooses characters and nicknames.
